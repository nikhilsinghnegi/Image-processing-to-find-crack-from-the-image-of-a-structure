# Image-processing-to-find-crack-from-the-image-of-a-structure
Here in this project, after developing the methodology we take the image of a structure with a crack and then try to find the crack in it and get it's dimensions as well. So that we can create it's cad drawing using it and further it could be used to create the 3d model of the crack.
